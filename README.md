# COVID tracker bot â€¢ India
## How I made it?
 - [covid19india](https://github.com/covid19india) is generous enough to provide the api to access this [JSON](https://api.covid19india.org/v4/data.json) file
 - Tweepy is imported in python to send twitter api requests for updating status and deleting past tweet
 - Automated using github actions and did a cron job to schedule every hour.
